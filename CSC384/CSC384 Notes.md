## 1. Uninformed and Heuristic Search

### Search Algorithms

#### Breadth First Search - BFS

##### Algorithm

Expand all nodes reachable from start in $i, i+1 \dots $ steps

##### Properties

- $b$ : maximum number of successors of any node

- $d$: depth of the shortest solution

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{d+1})$ 

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{d+1})$ 

Optimality: Yes, shortest solution

Completeness: Yes

$\checkmark$ Solution is complete and optimal

$\times$ Typically run out of space

#### Depth-First Search - DFS

##### Algorithm

Place new paths that extend the current path at the front 

##### Properties

Optimality: No

Completeness: Yes if $\exists$ finite and acyclic paths

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{m})$, where $m$ is the length longest path

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(bm)$ 

$\checkmark$ Only need to store current path + backtracking nodes

$\times$ May not be optimal/complete



#### Depth Limited Search

##### Algorithm

Perform DFS but only to a depth limit $d$

##### Properties

Optimality: No

Completeness: No, only if solution has depth $\leq d$

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{m})$, where $m$ is the length longest path

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(bm)$ 

$\checkmark$ No infinite length paths now

$\times$ Not optimal/complete



#### Iterative Deepening Search

##### Algorithm

Iteratively increase depth limit and perform depth limited search

##### Properties

Optimality: Yes

Completeness: Yes, if solution exist with depth $= d$

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{d})$

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(bd)$ 

$\checkmark$ Will find shortest length solution with small space requirement



### Cost Sensitive Search

#### Uniform-Cost Search 

Frontier is a priority queue ordered by min cost, always expand the least cost path. Terminate **only** when goal is removed from Frontier. 

##### Path Checking

Avoid running into cycles, will need to check if child about to expand is already a node in the current path

##### Cycle Checking

Check if $SAG$ was in the frontier then will not add $SCG$, need to keep track of all possible nodes and its current min cost to reach.

- The first time uniform-cost expands a state, it has found the min cost path to it

Space Complexity: $\approx$ space of BFS

##### Properties

Optimality: Yes

Completeness: Yes, assuming cost $> 0$

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{C^* /{\epsilon+1}})$, where $C^*$ is the cost of optimal solution, and $\epsilon+1$ is the min cost

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{C^* /{\epsilon+1}})$ 

$\checkmark$ Optimal and complete

$\times$ No information about goal state, need to explore w/o direction



### Heuristic Search

#### Best First Greedy Search

Greedily explore the min cost path using heuristic value.

#### A* Search

Take into account the cost of getting to the node + estimate of the cost of getting to the goal from the node

$f(n) = g(n)+ h(n)$

##### Property

- Only stop when we dequeue the goal, otherwise may not be best path

Complexity: 

- When $h(n)=0$, then same with uniform-cost search
- When $h(n)>0$ and admissible, then expand $\leq$ nodes than uniform-cost search

#### Weighted A* Search

A* but with a bias toward states near the goal

$f(n) = g(n)+ \epsilon * h(n)$

##### Property

- Paths may be sub-optimal, but may implement anytime algorithm to optimize 

#### Iterative Deepening $A^* $ - IDA$^*$

Want to reduce memory of $A^*$

Iteratively search for solution with cost $< f=g+h$  cutoff, only explore the most promising path, space << $A^*$.

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b^{m})$, same with $A^*$

Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(b d)$ 

Optimality: Yes

Completeness: Yes

#### Admissibility and Monotonicity

Consistency $\Rightarrow$ admissible

##### Admissible

Let $h^*(n)$ be the true cost of an optimal path from $n$ to a goal node. 

Then an admissible heuristic satisfies $h(n) \leq h^*(n)$, so that we never ignores a promising path while searching.

##### Monotonic (consistent)

A monotone heuristic satisfies the condition

â€‹													$h(n_1) \leq c(n_1, a,n_2) + h(n_2)$

This condition must hold for all transition from $n_1 \rightarrow n_2$

**Properties of Monotonicity** 

1. f-values of states in a path are non-decreasing
2. If $n_2$ is expanded after $n_1$, then $f(n_1) \leq f(n_2)$ 
3. If node $n$ has been expanded, every path with a lower f-value than $n$ has already been expanded
4. The first time $A^*$ expands a node, it has found the minimum cost path to that node

If $A^*$ is consistent, then the first discovered path is the optimal one. 



## 2. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

Want to find a set of values for the variables so that the variables satisfy the constraints.

**scope:** scope of $C(v_1, v_5)$ is $\{v_1, v_5\}$

### Backtracking Search

1. Get an unassigned variable
2. Assign it a value in the domain
3. Check if it violates any constraint, repeat (1) or (2)

### Constraint Propagation

#### Forward Checking

1. If constraint $C$ only has $X$ unassigned, check for each value $v$ in $Dom[X]$  if $v$ violates contraint $C$, remove $v$ from $Dom[X]$ if True. 
2. If $Dom[X] = \{\}$, return Domain Wiped Out
3. Else, return ok

<u>Intuition</u>:  If assigning a value to $Y$ leaves no legal assignment for $X$ where $X$ shares some constraint with $Y$, then we do not assign this value to $Y$.

If we need to backtrack, we should restore all pruned values. 

#### Minimum Remaining Value Heuristics (MRV)

Always branch on the most constrained variable, or the variable with the fewest legal left values in its domain.

#### Degree Heuristic

Select the variable that is involved in the largest number of constraints with other unassigned variables.

#### Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC)

- A constraint $C(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ is <u>GAC w.r.t $v_i$</u> if and only if $\forall x \in Dom[v_i]$, there exist a domain value for $v_1, \dots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n$ that satisfy the constraint.

- $C(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ is GAC if and only if it is GAC w.r.t every variable in the scope.
- A CSP is GAC if and only if all constraints are GAC

##### Algorithm

1. Get a unassigned variable $X$
2. For each $v$ in $Dom[X]$, assign a value to $X$ and put all constraints C with $X$ in its scope on a queue
3. For each $C$ on the queue, check if assigning $X$ this value will DMO any variable $Y$ sharing constraint with $X$
4. If so, then restore all pruned values and check the next value in $Dom[X]$

Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(cd^3)$ where $c$ is the number of binary constraints, and $d$ is the max size of variable domain. 



Can improve efficiency of GAC by keeping track of support, or the assignments to other variables that satisfies the constraints for a given value to $X$
